# Atliq Hardware Sales Insights Dashboard
## Problem Statement :
AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many clients across India.
At Atliq Hardware sales were dropping, and sales directors weren’t getting enough insights from regional sales managers. 
The Sales Director needed a clear view of our sales data to make better decisions and save time on manual data collection.
- Stakeholders:-
 - Sales Director
  - Marketing Team
  - Customer Service Team
  - Data and Analytics Team
  - IT

## Data Analysis using MySQL :
Analysis of data by looking into different tables and reflecting garbage values.
 
We can see that there are some garbage value in the table 'market'.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM market;
```
Then we can check the transaction table where we saw that there are some negative values in sales_amount which is not possible. Also, we can see that some transactions are in USD. Hence, filtration of that is also needed by converting it to INR.
So I created a new column named 'norm_sales_amount', using these queries, where all the transactions are in INR only.
```SQL
alter table transactions
add column norm_sales_amount double ;
update transactions 
set norm_sales_amount= case when currency ='USD' then sales_amount*75 else sales_amount end;
```
Analysis of different SQL statement on data base

1.To find of all customers records

SELECT * FROM sales.customers;

2.To find total number of customers

SELECT count(*) From sales.customers;

3.To find transactions for Chennai market (market code for chennai is Mark001

SELECT * FROM sales.transactions where market_code='Mark001';

4.To find distrinct product codes that were sold in chennai

SELECT distinct product_code FROM sales.transactions where market_code='Mark001';

5.To find transactions for Chennai market (market code for chennai is Mark002

SELECT * FROM sales.transactions where market_code='Mark002';

6.To find distrinct product codes that were sold in mumbai

SELECT distinct product_code FROM sales.transactions where market_code='Mark002';

7.To find transactions where currency is US dollars

SELECT * from sales.transactions where currency="USD";

8.To find transactions in 2020 join by date table

SELECT sales.transactions.*, sales.date.* FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020;

8.To find transactions in 2019 join by date table

SELECT sales.transactions.*, sales.date.* FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2019;

9.To find total revenue in year 2020,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r";

10.To find total revenue in year 2019,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2019 and sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r";

11.To find total revenue in year 2020, January Month,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.date.month_name="January" and (sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r");

12.To find total revenue in year 2020, February Month,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.date.month_name="February" and (sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r");

13.To find total revenue in year 2019, January Month,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.date.month_name="January" and (sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r");

14.To find total revenue in year 2019, February Month,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.date.month_name="February" and (sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r");

15.To find total revenue in year 2020 in Chennai

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.transactions.market_code="Mark001";

16.To find total revenue in year 2020 in Mumbai

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.transactions.market_code="Mark002";

Similarly, if we want different of any other particular city the market code of that city is used on the mysql workbench.

Data Cleaning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):
In this process, we are work on data cleaning and ETL.

Step 1: Connect the MySQL database with the PowerBI desktop.

Step 2: Loading data into the Power BI deskstop. This step load all the tables and created in the data base. This load option will connect with the SQL and pull all the records into power BI environment.

In that model view looking up for model which form the star schema.

Setp 3: Transform data with the help of Power Query

Perform filtration in market’s table: In the tables perform when we click on the transform data option, we are directed to Power query editor. Power query editor is where we perform out ETL.and then we can perform data transformation i.e. Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Data Munging. we need to filter the rows where the values are null and filtering the data and deselecting the blank option.

Perform filtration in Transaction’s table: In the table perform when we check the query in the MySQL to filter some negative values and also 0 values that appears in the table, the desired output is received.and we will perform the similar filtration in PowerBI. we have deselecting the values, don’t want in the table. The result after filtration. the zero values represent some garbage values which is not possible so we need to clean that data.

Convert USD into INR in the transaction’s table: the AtliQ Hardware only works in India so the USD values are not possible. we need to convert those USD values into INR by using some formulas. Add new column - Conditional column - normalized currency where sales amount will be in INR

In power query editore finding the total values having USD as currency.

 `=Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_sales_amount",each if [currency] = "USD" then [sales_amount]*75 else [sales_amount]`
using this correct formula of the conversion,and converted the USD currency into INR.

In MySQL Workbench find that there are duplicates of USD and INR

 `SELECT count(*) from sales.transactions where sales.transactions.currency="INR\r";` 
 150000 - can't removed as it is large amount

 `SELECT count(*) from sales.transactions where sales.transactions.currency="INR";` 
 279 - we can remove it as it is small record and can be considered as bad data

 `SELECT count(*) from sales.transactions where sales.transactions.currency="USD\r";` 

 `SELECT count(*) from sales.transactions where sales.transactions.currency="USD";`

 `SELECT * from sales.transactions where sales.transactions.currency='USD\r' or sales.transactions.currency='USD';`
we can see that it is duplicate and for analysis its better to delete anyone of them so lets delete USD and keep USD/r. finally we will keep data with INR/r and USD/r-

Data Modeling:
And then dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to the data modeled.
