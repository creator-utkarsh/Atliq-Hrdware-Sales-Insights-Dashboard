## Problem Statement :
AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many clients across India.
At Atliq Hardware sales were dropping, and sales directors werenâ€™t getting enough insights from regional sales managers. 
The Sales Director needed a clear view of our sales data to make better decisions and save time on manual data collection.
- Stakeholders :
  - Sales Director
  - Marketing Team
  - Customer Service Team
  - Data and Analytics Team
  - IT

## Data Analysis using MySQL :
Analysis of data by looking into different tables and reflecting garbage values.
 
We can see that there are some garbage value in the table 'market'.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM market;
```
Then we can check the transaction table where we saw that there are some negative values in sales_amount which is not possible. Also, we can see that some transactions are in USD. Hence, filtration of that is also needed by converting it to INR.
So I created a new column named 'norm_sales_amount', using these queries, where all the transactions are in INR only.
```SQL
alter table transactions
add column norm_sales_amount double ;
update transactions 
set norm_sales_amount= case when currency ='USD' then sales_amount*75 else sales_amount end;
```
Analysis of different SQL statements on the database. [SQL](https://github.com/creator-utkarsh/Atliq-Hrdware-Sales-Insights-Dashboard/blob/main/Sales%20Analysis.sql)


## Data Cleaning and Transformation :

In this process, we work on data cleaning and ETL.
- Removed blank and unnecessary rows from the zone column in the markets table.
- Cleaned and trimmed all the tables as required.
- Created a new table for the missing product code data which was available in transactions table but not in product table.
- Joined the new table data with 'Product' table using the 'Append Queries' function.
## Data modelling and DAX :

The dataset was cleaned, transformed and modeled as per STAR Schema.

Key Measure created for visualization and proper information :
- Profit Margin % = ``` DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin],[Revenue],0) ```
- Profit Margin Contribution % = ``` DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin],CALCULATE([Total Profit Margin],ALL('sales products'),ALL('sales 
  customers'),ALL('sales markets'))) ```
- Revenue = ``` SUM('sales transactions'[sales_amount]) ```
- Revenue Contribution % = ``` DIVIDE([Revenue],CALCULATE([Revenue],ALL('sales products'),ALL('sales customers'),ALL('sales markets'))) ```
- Revenue LY = ``` CALCULATE([Revenue],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('sales date'[date])) ```
- Sales quantity = ``` SUM('sales transactions'[sales_qty]) ```
- Total Profit Margin = ``` SUM('Sales transactions'[Profit_Margin]) ```

## Insights and Findings :
- Total Revenue and Sales Quantity in 2020: Atliq Hardware made INR 142.22M in revenue and sold 350K units. The Delhi market generated the highest revenue at INR 77.73M.
- Brick and Mortar is the main stronghold of this business, so expansion should be in plan.
- Bhubaneswar has been the highest ROI-generating market in the last 1 year with a profit margin of 10.5%
- South Zone is the highest profit margin generating market and should be more focused upon.
- Prod318 is the top performing product.
- Electricalsara stores is the top customer with the highest revenue of 413.3 M in all four years.
- There is some data integrity issue with the product table, many product codes are missing from it, so it must be taken care of from the source.
